# QuizAppProject

The Quiz App is a Java GUI-based application designed to facilitate interactive quizzes. Here are its key features:

Fixed Exams: Upon launching the application, users are greeted with two pre-defined exams that allow them to test the functionality of the program.

Scoring System: After completing a quiz, the application provides immediate feedback by displaying the user's score along with the percentage of correct answers.

Custom Exam Creation: Users have the option to create their own exams by adding questions and specifying the correct answers, enhancing the app's flexibility and usability.

This project showcases the integration of Java GUI components to create an engaging user experience while also allowing for personalized quiz creation.
